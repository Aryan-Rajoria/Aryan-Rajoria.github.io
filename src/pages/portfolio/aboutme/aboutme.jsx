                Hello! I’m a final year Computer Science major at Bennett
                University. I have developed a great interest in the field of
                Machine Learning and Image Processing after having been
                introduced to it in our coursework. I’m extremely interested in
                pursuing Independent research and a good internship would
                consolidate my future career choice. I’m personally interested
                in the applications of deep learning in 2D images and 3D scenes,
                also the use of Neural Architecture Search to improve upon these
                algorithms.
            </p>
        </div>
