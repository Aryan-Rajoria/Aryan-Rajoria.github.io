                Hello! I’m a final year Computer Science major at Bennett
                University. During my coursework, I have developed great
                interest in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial
                Intelligence. Using my strong background in software development
                and experience of working on a wide variety of projects, I would
                to pursue a career in ML research and a good internship would
                consolidate my future career choice. I’m personally interested
                in the field of meta learning and it use to improve the
                performance of machine learning algorithms.
            </p>
